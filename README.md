This project is a simple Machine Learning web application that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The system uses a HTML/CSS frontend for the user interface and a Python Flask backend to process the inputs and return predictions. A trained scikit-learn machine learning model is used to classify the flower species.
